# Superstore Sales Analysis Project 🛒

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data for a fictional retail superstore to identify profit hotspots and regional performance trends. The goal was to build an end-to-end data pipeline from raw data generation to executive-level visualization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python (Pandas):** Used to generate 2,000 rows of synthetic sales data with realistic business logic (seasonality, profit margins).
* **MySQL:** Database management for storing and structuring the clean data.
* **Power BI:** Built an interactive dashboard to visualize KPIs, trends, and regional breakdowns.
* **DAX:** Calculated custom metrics like Profit Margin %.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Healthy Margins:** The business is operating at a **15.6%** profit margin.
* **Regional Leader:** The **West** region is the most profitable, contributing 0.28M to the bottom line.
* **Q4 Drop:** Identified a significant drop in sales volume during Q4 2024, requiring further investigation into inventory or seasonal demand.
